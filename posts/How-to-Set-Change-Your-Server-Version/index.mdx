Server types allow you to set your Minecraft server to the version you would like to play, this includes Forge, Paper, Craftbukkit, Fabric and more!
  
If you have just ordered your very own Minecraft server, you need to select a server type before you can boot up your server and begin playing. but it automatically set to the latest version, but you want to use the older version. So how to change your minecraft version?

# How to Set / Change Your Server Version
before that make sure you stop your server ‚ú®

after that:
<ul>
	<li>select the server you want to change</li>

	<li>go to *Startup*</li>
	<li>Scroll down until you found ***MINECRAFT VERSION***</li>
	<li>Change "latest" into version that you wanna use for your server</li>
	<img src="https://cdn.abyditya.space/r/Screenshot_2023-03-22_225544.png" width="600px" />
	<li>it'll automatically save, and then go ahead to *Settings*</li>
	<li>Scroll down until you found ***Reinstall Server***</li>
	<li>Press "reinstall", you'll get a pop up, and click on "Yes, Reinstall Server"</li>
</ul>

reinstall is required, dont skip that part, and also reinstall wont delete your server data/plugins.
and also dont forget to start your server üç∫
