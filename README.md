# jpreagan.com

## ‚ú® My personal website built with Next.js

I built [jpreagan.com](https://jpreagan.com/) to showcase my personal brand and share my experiences, projects, and thoughts through a custom blog platform.

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **MDX**: [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)
- **Unit Testing**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- **CI/CD**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

The project is written in TypeScript. Linting is done using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and the code is formatted with [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

### Getting started

You can clone the repository and install depedencies with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpreagan/jpreagan.com.git
cd jpreagan.com
pnpm install
```

## üíÖ Make it your own

Feel free to use this source code as a starting point for your own personal website. Customize it to your needs and make it your own.

In the project directory, you can get rid of my personal data with:

```bash
# empty the posts directory
rm -rf posts/*

# replace my name with your name, if your name is Audrey Hepburn
grep -rl --exclude-dir={.git,.next,node_modules} 'James Reagan' . | xargs sed -i '' 's/James Reagan/Audrey Hepburn/g'

# replace my hashid with your hashid, see https://help.formspree.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015130174
sed -i '' 's/mdojozdp/your_hashid_here/g' ./components/contact-form.tsx
```

## üîëÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è Set environment variables

Copy over the `.env.example` to `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### üíº Projects

In `.env.local`, you'll need to set `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Create a GitHub [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

At a minimum, you'll need the following scopes: `public_repo` and `read:user`.

### üìª Spotify

For the Spotify data, you'll need to [signup for a free Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/signup) account.

You'll also need to set the following environment variables in `.env.local`:

- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

I wrote a [blog post](https://jpreagan.com/blog/starting-a-personal-dashboard-with-the-spotify-api) about how you can do that.

## üèÑ Running Locally

Build the application:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Start the server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Run the application in development:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Check for linting errors:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Format the code:

```bash
pnpm format
```

Check if the project is ready for the CI:

```bash
pnpm validate
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing blog posts

To create a blog post, you need to create a subdirectory under the `./posts` directory, with the name of the subdirectory corresponding to the URL of the blog post.

For instance, `/posts/my-first-post` will result in the URL [example.com/blog/my-first-post](https://example.com/blog/my-first-post). Within the subdirectory, you must create an `index.mdx` file which serves as the main content for the blog post. For example, `/posts/my-first-post/index.mdx`.

Here is a suggested template for writing a new blog post in this project:

```
---
title: "My first post"
date: "2023-01-30"
description: "Hello, world!"
---

## Hello World!

My first blog post.
```

You can also include React components in the same subdirectory by creating `.tsx` files, which will be bundled at build time and made available for use in your blog post. For example, create a new component in `/posts/my-first-post/demo.tsx`:

```typescript
import * as React from "react";

function Demo() {
  return <div>Neat demo!</div>;
}

export default Demo;
```

Finally, you can include the component in your blog post by adding the following code in the `index.mdx` file:

```
---
title: "My first post"
date: "2023-01-30"
description: "Hello, world!"
---

## Hello World!

import Demo from './demo'

<Demo />

My first blog post.
```

## üöÄ Deploy

### Configuring GitHub Actions for Vercel

1. Retrieve your [Vercel Access Token](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-use-a-vercel-api-access-token)
2. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) and run `vercel login`
3. Inside your folder, run `vercel link` to create a new Vercel project
4. Inside the generated `.vercel` folder, save the `projectId` and `orgId` from the `project.json`
5. Inside GitHub, add `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).

To ensure your application works as expected in production, you'll need to set the following environment variables:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

Find out more on how to set environment variables on Vercel from [this guide](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

### Deploying Your Vercel Application with GitHub Actions

Now that your Vercel application is configured with GitHub Actions, you can try out the workflow:

- Create a new pull request to your GitHub repository
- GitHub Actions will recognize the change and use the Vercel CLI to build your application
- The Action uploads the build output to Vercel and creates a Preview Deployment
- When the pull request is merged, a Production build is created and deployed

Every pull request will now automatically have a Preview Deployment attached. If the pull request needs to be rolled back, you can revert and merge the PR and Vercel will start a new Production build back to the old git state.
